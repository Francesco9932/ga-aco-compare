Comparison between Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in the optimization of minimum path applied to the TSP for a university course project named "Decision Support Systems 2022-2023". The analysis is based on two metrics (with different combinations of hyperparameters): values of the best solution found and execution time.
